## Contributions
> My teacher, and TAs were a big help in explaining the process of describing WebPack and all the intriquecies of building a PWA (Progressive Web App).  My tutor, Corey Yates, went above and beyond this week to make sure I had sufficient understanding. This is a relatively new application development, and Corey investigated to make sure she could help me to the best of her ability.
